# MyTeacher - Student Information System for Teachers 

- This project implements object-oriented programming in Java to create an application for teachers to track their classes, students, assignments, and grades.

#### Examples of program functions include: 
- create courses with a unique name and ID 
- create students with a unique name
- link students to a certain course and any assignments created for the course 
- grade assignments 
etc... 

[2025-01-02] The project's initial phase is complete. It supports all intended functionalities; however, in the future I will implement a database for it so users can save data as well as a frontend so it can function as an actual application.
